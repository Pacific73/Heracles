Overview
========

PQoS library provides API to detect and configure Intel(R) RDT including:
Cache Monitoring Technology (CMT), Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM),
Cache Allocation Technology (CAT), Code and Data Prioritization (CDP) Technology.
For more information about Intel(R) RDT please see top level README.


Installation
============

NOTE to FreeBSD users, remember to replace "make" with "gmake" in
the steps described below.

The following steps are required to compile and install library:
$ make
$ sudo make install

By default make builds shared library.

"make" accepts extra options e.g.:
"SHARED=n" - for static library
"DEBUG=y" - for library for debugging

"sudo make install" installs compiled library into system directories.

By default, library files are installed in "lib" directory below "/usr/local"
but it can be changed with use of PREFIX to install files below "/some/where":
$ sudo make install PREFIX=/some/where

Library files can be removed but the same PREFIX has to be
used for uninstall and install targets.

To remove files from below default PREFIX:
$ sudo make uninstall

To remove from below /some/where:
$ sudo make uninstall PREFIX=/some/where

For more info about make targets, please run "make help" command.
